# Project Images

This directory contains images for the portfolio projects. You should replace the placeholder images with actual screenshots of your projects:

- customer-portal.jpg
- education-platform.jpg
- auth-finance.jpg
- spotify-clone.jpg

For each project, you should add a high-quality screenshot or mockup that best represents the project. The recommended image dimensions are 1200x800 pixels, and the format should be JPG or PNG.
